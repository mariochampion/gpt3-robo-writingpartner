**Requires** 

 1. Python installed
 
    -- This script uses Python 3, and so i didnt test Python 2.7 (which ships with macOS)
    
 2. An openai API key
 
    -- If you don't have one, you can request one at https://beta.openai.com
    
 3. Know how to add and export environment variables to your bash_profile, so you do not put your APIKEY in source control
